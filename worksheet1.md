### Question A

Create a program that asks the user for their age, and tells the user what rated movies they can watch in the cinema. 

* if the age is younger then 12 they can watch movies 
  rated G and PG and 12A(but accompanied by an adult) and 15A(but accompanied by an adult)
  
* if the age is 12 they can watch movies 
  rated G, PG, 12A and 15A(but accompanied by an adult)
 
* if the age is atleast 15 they can watch movies 
  rated G, PG, 12A and 15A

* if the age is 18 or older then they can watch movies 
  rated G, PG, 12A, 15A, 16 and 18
